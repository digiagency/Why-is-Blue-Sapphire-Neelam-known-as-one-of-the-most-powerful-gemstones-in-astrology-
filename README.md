Blue Sapphire, popularly known as Neelam, is ruled by planet Saturn (Shani), which is considered one of the most influential planets in Vedic astrology. This gemstone is famous for its ability to bring instant results—both positive and negative—depending on an individual’s horoscope. When suited, Blue Sapphire enhances wealth, success, and fame rapidly. It protects the wearer from accidents, enemies, and evil influences. It is highly effective for people dealing with professional struggles, financial instability, or health issues caused by Saturn’s malefic effects. Neelam is also known to improve focus, discipline, and decision-making, making it ideal for businesspersons, leaders, and politicians. However, astrologers advise extreme caution before wearing it, as an unsuitable Blue Sapphire can bring challenges. Only certified gemstones should be used, and astrological consultation is a must. Wearing Neelam can unlock hidden potential and grant long-term prosperity when aligned with the right planetary positions.
